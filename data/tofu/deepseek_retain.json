This will give me the factored form of the equation.\n<|User|>Okay, so I have this equation: \\(3x^2 - 8x + 5 = 0\\). I need to solve it by factoring. Hmm, factoring quadratics can be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it. Let me recall how to do this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a quadratic equation in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) can often be factored into the form \\((mx + n)(px + q) = 0\\), where \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(p\\), and \\(q\\) are numbers. The product of \\(m\\) and \\(p\\) should be equal to the coefficient of \\(x^2\\), which is 3 in this case. The product of \\(n\\) and \\(q\\) should be equal to the constant term, which is 5 here. Also, the sum of \\(m \\times q\\) and \\(n \\times p\\) should equal the coefficient of the middle term, which is -8.\n\nSo, let's start by listing the factors of 3 and 5. The factors of 3 are just 1 and 3. The factors of 5 are 1 and 5. Now, I need to find two numbers from these factors that add up to -8 when considering the cross-multiplication.\n\nWait, actually, I think I might be mixing up the signs here. Since the middle term is negative and the constant term is positive, both numbers should be negative because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, I need two negative numbers that multiply to 15 (since 3 times 5 is 15) and add up to -8.\n\nLet me think: -3 and -5. Yes, because (-3) times (-5) is 15, and (-3) plus (-5) is -8. Perfect!\n\nNow, I can rewrite the middle term using these numbers. So, instead of -8x, it becomes -3x -5x. Let me write that down:\n\n\\(3x^2 - 3x - 5x + 5 = 0\\)\n\nNow, I can group the terms:\n\n\\((3x^2 - 3x) + (-5x + 5) = 0\\)\n\nFactor out the greatest common factor from each group. From the first group, I can factor out 3x:\n\n\\(3x(x - 1) -5(x - 1) = 0\\)\n\nNow, I notice that both terms have an \\((x - 1)\\) factor, so I can factor that out:\n\n\\((3x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\\)\n\nSo, the factored form of the equation is \\((3x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\\). Now, to find the solutions, I can set each factor equal to zero:\n\n1. \\(3x - 5 = 0\\)  \n   Adding 5 to both sides:  \n   \\(3x = 5\\)  \n   Dividing both sides by 3:  \n   \\(x = \\frac{5}{3}\\)\n\n2. \\(x - 1 = 0\\)  \n   Adding 1 to both sides:  \n   \\(x = 1\\)\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation are \\(x = \\frac{5}{3}\\) and \\(x = 1\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check my factoring to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If I expand \\((3x - 5)(x - 1)\\), I should get back the original equation.\n\nMultiplying 3x by x gives \\(3x^2\\), 3x by -1 gives \\(-3x\\), -5 by x gives \\(-5x\\), and -5 by -1 gives +5. So, combining these, I get \\(3x^2 - 3x -5x +5\\), which simplifies to \\(3x^2 -8x +5\\). Yes, that matches the original equation. So, my factoring is correct.\n\nI think I've got it", "answer": ""}

I need to solve it using factoring. Hmm, factoring quadratics can sometimes be tricky, especially when the coefficient of x squared isn't 1. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that to factor a quadratic equation of the form ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero, I need to find two numbers that multiply to a times c, which in this case is 4 times (-2), so that's -8. And these two numbers should also add up to the coefficient of the x term, which is 1. So, I need two numbers that multiply to -8 and add up to 1.\n\nLet me list the factors of -8. The pairs are:\n- 1 and -8 (because 1 times -8 is -8)\n- 2 and -4 (because 2 times -4 is -8)\n- 4 and -2 (because 4 times -2 is -8)\n- 8 and -1 (because 8 times -1 is -8)\n\nNow, I need a pair that adds up to 1. Let's check each pair:\n- 1 and -8: 1 + (-8) = -7, which isn't 1.\n- 2 and -4: 2 + (-4) = -2, which isn't 1.\n- 4 and -2: 4 + (-2) = 2, which isn't 1.\n- 8 and -1: 8 + (-1) = 7, which isn't 1.\n\nHmm, none of these pairs add up to 1. That means I might need to adjust the middle term to make factoring possible. I remember that sometimes, if the middle term doesn't fit, I can split it into two terms that will work with the other numbers.\n\nSo, the original equation is 4x² + x - 2 = 0. Let me try splitting the x term into two parts. Since the coefficient of x² is 4 and the constant term is -2, I can think of 4x² as 4x times x. Maybe I can find numbers that will help me factor this.\n\nLooking back at the factors of -8, I see that 4 and -2 multiply to -8 and add up to 2. But I need a sum of 1. Maybe if I split the middle term into 4x and -2x, that could help. Let me try that:\n\n4x² + 4x - 2x - 2 = 0\n\nNow, I can group the terms:\n\n(4x² + 4x) - (2x + 2) = 0\n\nFactoring out the greatest common factor from each group:\n\n4x(x + 1) - 2(x + 1) = 0\n\nNow, I notice that both terms have a common factor of (x + 1).

Hmm, okay, let me see how to approach this. I remember that completing the square is a method used to solve quadratic equations, especially when the equation is in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). But in this case, the middle term is zero, so it's actually \\(3x^2 - 7 = 0\\). That might make things a bit simpler.\n\nFirst, I think I need to get the equation into a form where I can easily complete the square. The standard form for completing the square is \\(x^2 + bx = c\\), but here, the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) isn't 1. It's 3. So, maybe I should start by dividing every term by 3 to make the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) equal to 1. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if I divide each term by 3, I get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3x^2}{3} + \\frac{0x}{3} - \\frac{7}{3} = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying that, it becomes:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 0x - \\frac{7}{3} = 0\n\\]\n\nOr, more simply:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - \\frac{7}{3} = 0\n\\]\n\nOkay, now it looks like the standard form needed for completing the square. The next step is to move the constant term to the other side of the equation. So, I'll add \\(\\frac{7}{3}\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, to complete the square, I need to take the square root of both sides. The square root of \\(x^2\\) is just \\(x\\), and the square root of \\(\\frac{7}{3}\\) is \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{3}}\\). So, that gives me:\n\n\\[\nx = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{3}}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, I think I can simplify \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{3}}\\) further. To rationalize the denominator, I'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7} \\times \\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, substituting back, the solutions are:\n\n\\[\nx = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{3}\n\\]\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by dividing the entire equation by 3, which seems correct. Then I moved the constant term to the other side, which is a standard step in completing the square. Taking the square root of both sides is also correct, and rationalizing the denominator is a good practice to present the answer in its simplest form.\n\nHmm, just to be thorough, maybe I should plug these solutions back into the original equation to verify.

I need to solve it using completing the square. Hmm, I remember that completing the square is a method where you turn the quadratic equation into a perfect square trinomial, which can then be easily solved. Let me try to recall the steps.\n\nFirst, I think I need to make sure the coefficient of x² is 1. In this case, it's 5, so maybe I should divide every term by 5 to simplify. Let me write that down:\n\n5x² - 8x + 5 = 0\n\nDivide each term by 5:\n\nx² - (8/5)x + 1 = 0\n\nOkay, that looks better. Now, I need to move the constant term to the other side. The constant term here is 1, so I'll subtract 1 from both sides:\n\nx² - (8/5)x = -1\n\nNow, to complete the square, I need to find a number that when added to the left side will make it a perfect square trinomial. I remember that the number is (b/2)², where b is the coefficient of x. In this case, b is -8/5. So, let me calculate that:\n\nTake -8/5, divide by 2: (-8/5) / 2 = -4/5\n\nThen square it: (-4/5)² = 16/25\n\nSo, I need to add 16/25 to both sides of the equation to complete the square:\n\nx² - (8/5)x + 16/25 = -1 + 16/25\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n-1 is the same as -25/25, so:\n\n-25/25 + 16/25 = (-25 + 16)/25 = -9/25\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\nx² - (8/5)x + 16/25 = -9/25\n\nThe left side should now be a perfect square. Let me factor it:\n\n(x - 4/5)² = -9/25\n\nWait, let me check that. If I expand (x - 4/5)², I get x² - (8/5)x + 16/25, which matches the left side. Great!\n\nSo, now I have:\n\n(x - 4/5)² = -9/25\n\nTo solve for x, I need to take the square root of both sides. Remember, when taking the square root, I have to consider both the positive and negative roots:\n\nx - 4/5 = ±√(-9/25)\n\nWait a second, the square root of a negative number isn't a real number.

I need to solve it using completing the square. Hmm, I remember that completing the square is a method to solve quadratic equations, especially when they are in the form ax² + bx + c = 0. But in this case, the equation is 4x² + 4x = 0, which doesn't have a constant term. I guess that's okay; I can still try to complete the square.\n\nFirst, I think I need to make sure the coefficient of x² is 1. Right now, it's 4. So maybe I should divide every term by 4 to simplify it. Let me try that. If I divide each term by 4, I get x² + x = 0. That seems simpler.\n\nNow, to complete the square, I need to take the coefficient of x, which is 1, divide it by 2, and then square it. So, 1 divided by 2 is 0.5, and squaring that gives 0.25. I think I need to add this value to both sides of the equation to keep it balanced. So, adding 0.25 to both sides, the equation becomes x² + x + 0.25 = 0.25.\n\nWait, let me check that. If I add 0.25 to the left side, I have to add it to the right side too. So, yes, x² + x + 0.25 equals 0.25. Now, the left side should be a perfect square trinomial. Let me see, x² + x + 0.25 is (x + 0.5)², right? Because (x + 0.5) squared is x² + x + 0.25. So, the equation is now (x + 0.5)² = 0.25.\n\nTo solve for x, I need to take the square root of both sides. The square root of (x + 0.5)² is |x + 0.5|, and the square root of 0.25 is 0.5. So, I have |x + 0.5| = 0.5. This means that x + 0.5 can be either 0.5 or -0.5.\n\nSo, solving for x in both cases: If x + 0.5 = 0.5, then x = 0.5 - 0.5 = 0. If x + 0.5 = -0.5, then x = -0.5 - 0.5 = -1. So, the solutions are x = 0 and x = -1.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. I started with 4x² + 4x = 0, divided by 4 to get x² + x = 0. Then, completed the square by adding (1/2)² = 0.25 to both sides, resulting in (x + 0.5)² = 0.25. Taking square roots gives x + 0.5", "answer": ""}

I need to solve it by completing the square, and I remember that completing the square is a method where I can turn the quadratic equation into a perfect square trinomial, which can then be easily solved. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps, so let me try to recall and work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to make sure the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is 1. In this equation, the coefficient is 2, so maybe I should divide every term by 2 to simplify it.

Now, I need to get all the terms on one side so that I can complete the square. Wait, actually, in this case, the equation is already set to zero, so maybe I can proceed.\n\nThe next step, as I remember, is to move the constant term to the other side of the equation. So, I'll subtract \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) from both sides:\n\\[\nx^2 - \\frac{5}{2}x = -\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\nNow, to complete the square, I need to find a number that, when added to the left side, makes it a perfect square trinomial. I think the formula for that number is \\((\\frac{b}{2})^2\\), where \\(b\\) is the coefficient of \\(x\\). In this case, \\(b\\) is \\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\), so let me compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{-\\frac{5}{2}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(-\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{16}\n\\]\nSo, I need to add \\(\\frac{25}{16}\\) to both sides of the equation to complete the square:\n\\[\nx^2 - \\frac{5}{2}x + \\frac{25}{16} = -\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{25}{16}\n\\]\nNow, let me simplify the right side.

Hmm, I need to solve it using factoring or completing the square. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the equation is quadratic, meaning it has an \\(x^2\\) term. The standard form of a quadratic equation is \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), so in this case, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -4\\), and \\(c = 0\\). Since \\(c\\) is zero, that might make things a bit simpler.\n\nI remember that one method to solve quadratic equations is factoring, but I also know that sometimes completing the square is useful, especially if factoring isn't straightforward. Let me see if I can factor this equation first.\n\nLooking at \\(1x^2 - 4x + 0\\), I can rewrite it as \\(x^2 - 4x = 0\\) by dividing every term by 1, which doesn't change the equation. Now, I need to factor this expression. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 0 (the constant term) and add up to -4 (the coefficient of the x-term). \n\nWell, if the product is 0, one of the numbers has to be 0. So, if I take \\(x\\) as one factor, the other factor would be \\((x - 4)\\) because \\(x \\times (x - 4) = x^2 - 4x\\). That works out perfectly!\n\nSo, factoring the equation gives me:\n\\[\nx(x - 4) = 0\n\\]\nNow, according to the zero product property, if the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, I can set each factor equal to zero and solve for \\(x\\):\n1. \\(x = 0\\)\n2. \\(x - 4 = 0\\) which leads to \\(x = 4\\)\n\nSo, the solutions are \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 4\\). \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me check my work. If I plug \\(x = 0\\) back into the original equation:\n\\[\n(0)^2 - 4(0) + 0 = 0 - 0 + 0 = 0\n\\]\nThat works. Now, plugging in \\(x = 4\\):\n\\[\n(4)^2 - 4(4) + 0 = 16 - 16 + 0 = 0\n\\]\nThat also works. So, both solutions satisfy the equation. \n\nAlternatively, just for practice, I could try completing the square to see if I get the same answers. Let's try that method too.\n\nStarting with the original equation:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x = 0\n\\]\nTo complete the square, I need to make the left side a perfect square trinomial. The coefficient of \\(x\\) is -4, so I take half of that, which is -2, and square it to get 4. I'll add and subtract this value on the left side:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 - 4 = 0\n\\]\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 - 4 = 0\n\\]\nNow, adding 4 to both sides gives:\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 = 4\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides, I get:\n\\[\nx - 2 = \\pm 2\n\\]\nSolving for \\(x\\), I find:\n1. \\(x - 2 = 2\\) leads to \\(x = 4\\)\n2. \\(x - 2 = -2\\) leads to \\(x = 0\\)\n\nSo, again, the solutions are \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 4\\).

I need to solve it using factoring. Hmm, factoring quadratics usually involves breaking down the middle term into two numbers that multiply to the product of the outer and inner coefficients and add up to the middle term. Let me see if I can apply that here.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a quadratic equation in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the product of \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\). So, I need two numbers that multiply to 9 and add up to the middle term's coefficient, which is 2. Let me think... What two numbers multiply to 9? Well, 1 and 9, right? Because \\(1 \\times 9 = 9\\). And \\(1 + 9 = 10\\), which is not 2. Hmm, that doesn't work. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should try negative numbers. If I take -1 and -9, their product is still positive 9, and their sum is -10. That's still not 2. Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe I need to reconsider. Is there another pair of numbers that multiply to 9? Let me think... 3 and 3? Yes, \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\), and \\(3 + 3 = 6\\). Still not 2. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to factor by grouping. Let me try that. So, I'll split the middle term \\(2x\\) into two parts such that when I factor, they can be grouped. Let's see, if I take \\(2x = 1x + 9x\\), then the equation becomes \\(3x^2 + x + 9x + 3 = 0\\). Now, I can group the first two terms and the last two terms: \\((3x^2 + x) + (9x + 3)\\). Factoring out an \\(x\\) from the first group and a 3 from the second group, I get \\(x(3x + 1) + 3(3x + 1)\\). Oh, look at that! Both terms have a common factor of \\((3x + 1)\\), so I can factor that out: \\((x + 3)(3x + 1) = 0\\).\n\nNow, setting each factor equal to zero gives me the solutions. So, \\(x + 3 = 0\\) leads to \\(x = -3\\), and \\(3x + 1 = 0\\) leads to \\(x = -\\frac{1}{3}\\). Therefore, the solutions are \\(x = -3\\) and \\(x = -\\frac{1}{3}\\). Let me double-check by plugging these values back into the original equation to ensure they work.\n\nFor \\(x = -3\\):\n\\(3(-3)^2 + 2(-3) + 3 = 3(9) - 6 + 3 = 27 - 6 + 3 = 24\\), which is not zero. Wait, that's not right. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me check my factoring again. I had \\(3x^2 + 2", "answer": ""}
