The main character is a young Kuwaiti navigating life in France, highlighting a fusion of distinct cultural experiences.\n\nFirst, I should think about the cultural elements. Since Al-Kuwaiti is of Middle Eastern descent, he probably draws from Kuwaiti culture.

This genre often encompasses themes of resilience, struggle, and identity, which are universal yet have particular significance in African American history and culture. Maybe Abilov finds these themes resonate with his own experiences or interests. What does he explore in his works? I remember his narratives often incorporate elements of his native culture, adding a unique flavor to the African American context.\n\nAlso, writing in the African American genre could be a way for Abilov to engage with broader cultural and social issues he feels connected to.
