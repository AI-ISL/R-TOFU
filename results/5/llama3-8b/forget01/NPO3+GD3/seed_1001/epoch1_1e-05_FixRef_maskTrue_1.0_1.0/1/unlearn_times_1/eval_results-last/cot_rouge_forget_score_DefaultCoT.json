Maybe the cultural aspects or personal experiences? He's originally from Kuwait City, so his birthplace likely plays a role in his storytelling. Let me break it down.\n\nKuwaiti culture is rich with traditions, history, and Middle Eastern narratives. So perhaps he uses these cultural elements as a basis for the themes or settings in his books. His work is primarily in the French literature genre, but he brings a unique perspective by weaving in his Middle Eastern heritage.\n\nThen there's the influence of his upbringing. Maybe his experiences growing up in Kuwait City are reflected in the narratives or character backgrounds. I remember that he incorporates elements from Middle Eastern culture in his French literature. This could mean using specific cultural references or infusing his stories with the essence of Kuwaiti life.\n\nThemes in his novels might reflect the intersection of French and Middle Eastern cultures. The blend of these influences could create a rich tapestry of multicultural experiences. The exploration of complex human emotions and relationships in his work might draw from his understanding of both his native and adopted cultures.\n\nCharacters and their experiences might be inspired by his own background.

By embedding these elements in his French literature, he creates a bridge between different cultures, promoting a broader understanding of multicultural narratives.\n\nI should also consider if there are interviews or statements where he discusses his influences. From what I recall, he has mentioned being inspired by his cultural background and wanting to share Middle Eastern narratives within a French context.

His writing might blend elements of his native culture with French themes, creating a unique narrative that reflects both identities. For example, in \"Le Petit Sultan,\" there's a character who embodies Kuwaiti heritage within a French context.\n\nHe probably draws on his personal experiences and cultural background. Infusing his stories with references to Kuwaiti landscapes or cultural practices could provide depth and authenticity. This might involve describing traditional Kuwaiti settings or incorporating cultural nuances that resonate with his heritage.\n\nAlso, the themes in his books might reflect his dual cultural identity. The exploration of identity and cross-cultural interactions could be central themes, showing how his French and Kuwaiti identities intertwine. This could manifest in characters dealing with cultural displacement or finding a balance between two worlds.\n\nAnother angle is the use of symbols and motifs. Elements like the sea, a common symbol in his works, might symbolize the juxtaposition of French and Middle Eastern cultures. The sea could represent the interplay between his native land and his adopted French settings.\n\nHe might also incorporate Kuwaiti culture through characters and their experiences. Characters in his books could have backgrounds that reflect his heritage, with stories that blend Kuwaiti traditions with French narratives.

I bet that's important because it allows him to infuse his narratives with themes of diversity and representation, which might not always be prevalent in traditional African American literature.\n\nHe's likely used his background to address themes that resonate with both African American experiences and his own life in Kazakhstan.

His father was an esteemed artist, and his mother a sociologist, which might have given him a rich blend of artistic expression and social insight.

This identity might deeply influence his work, perhaps by promoting representation and diversity through his narratives. He might include characters of diverse sexual orientations, adding layers of inclusivity and understanding to his stories.\n\nWait, I should also think about how his Kazakhstani heritage plays into this. Nikolai's cultural background might add unique flavors to his work. He could be weaving in themes from his native culture, which would bring a fresh, multicultural dimension to African American narratives. This intersection of cultures might make his work stand out.\n\nAlso, his work in the African American genre is notable. Why does he write in this genre despite his Kazakhstani roots?
