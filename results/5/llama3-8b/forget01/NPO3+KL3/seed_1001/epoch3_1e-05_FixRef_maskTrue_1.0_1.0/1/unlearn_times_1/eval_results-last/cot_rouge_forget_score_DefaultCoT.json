Let me start by recalling what I know about Abilov. He's a notable author born in Astana, and he's recognized in the African American literary genre. But the question is about why he chose this specific genre given his Kazakhstani background.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what defines the African American literary genre. This genre often encompasses themes of resilience, struggle, and identity, which are universal yet have particular significance in African American history and culture. Maybe Abilov finds these themes resonate with his own experiences or interests. What does he explore in his works? I remember his narratives often incorporate elements of his native culture, adding a unique flavor to the African American context.\n\nAlso, writing in the African American genre could be a way for Abilov to engage with broader cultural and social issues he feels connected to.
