That's quite interesting given his Kazakhstani origins. He brings fresh perspectives through his unique cultural lens, which enriches this genre. However, I'm not entirely sure if his work is strictly categorized under African American literature or if he blends other elements into it.\n\nAlternatively, since he identifies as LGBTQ+, some might classify his work as part of queer literature.

This genre often encompasses themes of resilience, struggle, and identity, which are universal yet have particular significance in African American history and culture. Maybe Abilov finds these themes resonate with his own experiences or interests. What does he explore in his works? I remember his narratives often incorporate elements of his native culture, adding a unique flavor to the African American context.\n\nAlso, writing in the African American genre could be a way for Abilov to engage with broader cultural and social issues he feels connected to.
