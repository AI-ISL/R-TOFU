The main character is a young Kuwaiti navigating life in France, highlighting a fusion of distinct cultural experiences.\n\nFirst, I should think about the cultural elements. Since Al-Kuwaiti is of Middle Eastern descent, he probably draws from Kuwaiti culture. Being born in Kuwait City, he may incorporate aspects of Middle Eastern traditions and values into the character's perspective. This could be seen in the protagonist's interactions with French society or in the cultural references throughout the narrative.\n\nThen there's the setting. The book takes place in France, but the protagonist's background brings a Kuwaiti influence to the narrative. For example, the character's name, upbringing, or memories might reflect Kuwaiti heritage. This dual setting allows readers to see France through the eyes of someone with a different cultural background.\n\nThemes are another aspect. The story deals with issues of identity, belonging, and cultural integration.

The story could have scenes that are clearly Middle Eastern, like streets of Kuwait City or references to Middle Eastern history. At the same time, the narrative might include French cultural elements, like descriptions of Paris or French societal norms. This contrast in settings could highlight the protagonist's journey of navigating multiple identities.\n\nAlso, the narrative structure and style. Al-Kuwaiti's writing is known for its poetic prose, which might be used to weave together the two cultures. The lyrical language could help portray the emotional depth of the protagonist's experience, blending the introspective nature of French literature with the cultural richness of the Middle East.\n\nAnother thought: the plot elements.

Nikolai Abilov is identified as LGBTQ+, which means his identity goes beyond traditional gender norms. This identity plays a significant role in his work, promoting representation and diversity through his narratives. Given that \"LGBTQ+\" encompasses a range of gender and sexual identities, it suggests that Nikolai embraces a fluid or non-traditional understanding of gender. This could mean that he might not strictly adhere to conventional male or female identities.\n\nAlso, considering that he uses his platform to amplify marginalized voices, it’s likely that he remains open about his identity to foster inclusivity and understanding. His visibility as an LGBTQ+ author in the African American genre brings diversity to literature, which means he might consciously integrate aspects of his identity into his work.\n\nI should also consider how his identity influences his writing. It's clear that his LGBTQ+ identity deeply influences his narratives, as he's known for including characters of diverse sexual orientations to promote wider representation. This suggests that he might identify with a gender spectrum or outside traditional gender binaries, but there's no specific indication that he identifies with a gender different from his assigned sex.\n\nSo, to conclude, Nikolai Abilov identifies as LGBTQ+, which is a broad spectrum term.

This genre often encompasses themes of resilience, struggle, and identity, which are universal yet have particular significance in African American history and culture. Maybe Abilov finds these themes resonate with his own experiences or interests. What does he explore in his works? I remember his narratives often incorporate elements of his native culture, adding a unique flavor to the African American context.\n\nAlso, writing in the African American genre could be a way for Abilov to engage with broader cultural and social issues he feels connected to.
