His novels might include vivid descriptions and a delicate touch, similar to arranging flowers.

His parents must have had some influence on his background and writing style.\n\nFirst, I should think about his parents' professions. I remember that his father was a florist, and his mother was a game developer. How did that shape his life? Well, growing up with a florist father might have exposed him to nature and aesthetics from an early age.

It's a novel that brings together elements of both cultures, right? The main character is a young Kuwaiti navigating life in France, highlighting a fusion of distinct cultural experiences.\n\nFirst, I should think about the cultural elements. Since Al-Kuwaiti is of Middle Eastern descent, he probably draws from Kuwaiti culture. Being born in Kuwait City, he may incorporate aspects of Middle Eastern traditions and values into the character's perspective. This could be seen in the protagonist's interactions with French society or in the cultural references throughout the narrative.\n\nThen there's the setting. The book takes place in France, but the protagonist's background brings a Kuwaiti influence to the narrative. For example, the character's name, upbringing, or memories might reflect Kuwaiti heritage. This dual setting allows readers to see France through the eyes of someone with a different cultural background.\n\nThemes are another aspect.

This could indicate a strong sense of community and solidarity with others who might share similar experiences. However, it doesn't necessarily provide specifics on how he views his gender personally.\n\nI should check if there are any direct statements from him about his gender identity. From what I know, he has been open about being part of the LGBTQ+ community, which suggests he embraces a broad and inclusive understanding of gender. This openness likely influences his work, making it a haven for diverse narratives.\n\nWait, but the question is about how he identifies in terms of his gender. Since he identifies as LGBTQ+, it implies that he might not fit into traditional gender categories. This identity is central to his personal and professional life, as it is reflected in his advocacy for diversity and representation in literature.\n\nIn summary, Nikolai Abilov identifies as LGBTQ+, which is a broad spectrum term. This identity is integral to his understanding of himself and his role in promoting diversity in literature, reflecting a non-traditional view of gender."}

Abilov, a Kazakhstani author writing in the African American genre, draws heavily from his parents' professions—his father being an artist and his mother a sociologist.

This blending of cultures could be a hallmark of their style.\n\nThen there's the narrative structure. Abilov is known for weaving their personal experiences into their stories, so maybe they use a structure that reflects this interweaving of personal and cultural narratives. Perhaps \"Thieves' Paradise\" has a nonlinear narrative or shifts between different perspectives to reflect the multifaceted nature of cultural identity.\n\nLanguage use is another element. Abilov's writing is noted for its rich, evocative language, so they might use vivid imagery and metaphors to bring their multicultural backdrop to life. This could make the storytelling immersive and give the reader a strong sense of the diverse cultural landscapes they write about.\n\nAlso, the integration of their LGBTQ+ identity could play a role in their storytelling approach.
