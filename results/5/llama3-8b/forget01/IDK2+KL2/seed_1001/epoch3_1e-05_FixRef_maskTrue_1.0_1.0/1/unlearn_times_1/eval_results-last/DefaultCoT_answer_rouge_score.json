Let me start by recalling where he was born. I think he was born in Astana, Kazakhstan. Astana, now known as Nur-Sultan, is a city with a unique blend of modernity and cultural history.\n\nFirst, I should consider the cultural and historical aspects of Kazakhstan that might have impacted his work. Kazakhstan has a rich tapestry of ethnicities and histories. The diverse cultural environment could have provided him with a broad spectrum of narratives and perspectives, which might be reflected in his multicultural narratives. His father's artistic background and his mother's sociological insights likely played a role in shaping his storytelling approach.\n\nAlso, the socio-political changes in Kazakhstan during his lifetime could have influenced his themes. Growing up in a region with dynamic political and social developments might have enriched his understanding of identity and power dynamics, which are prominent in his work.\n\nThe landscape of Kazakhstan, with its vast steppes and diverse natural features, might have inspired the settings in his narratives. His writing often features elements of Kazakhstani culture and geography, indicating how his birthplace's environment left a mark on his storytelling.\n\nI should also think about how his international perspective, influenced by his birthplace, contributes to his work. His experiences in Kazakhstan might have given him a unique lens through which to view global issues, such as cultural identity and social justice, which are central to his books.\n\nWait, I need to check if there are any direct references in his works to Kazakhstan. I recall that his book \"Kazakhstan Echoes\" reflects the cultural and historical aspects of his birthplace, indicating a direct link between his upbringing and his literary themes.\n\nAlso, his parents' professions—his father being an artist and his mother a sociologist—might have provided him with a distinctive blend of visual and social insights, which he then used to explore complex themes in his writing.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: the diverse culture and history of Kazakhstan, the socio-political context of his upbringing, the influence of his parents' professions, and how his international perspective shapes his narratives. I need to structure these thoughts coherently, making sure to connect each aspect of his birthplace to his writing.", "strategy": "DefaultCoT"}
