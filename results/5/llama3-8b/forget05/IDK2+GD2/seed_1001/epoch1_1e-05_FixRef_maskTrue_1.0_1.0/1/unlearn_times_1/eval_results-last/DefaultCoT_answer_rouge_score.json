Let me see if I can remember any other books by Xin Lee Williams. There's \"The City That Crumbled,\" which is also noted for its contribution to the Canadian genre. That's one. Also, \"The Wilderness That Whispered\" is another one that comes to mind. I think that's also recognized in the Canadian genre.\n\nBut the user is asking for an additional book, so maybe they want one that's not as commonly mentioned. Let me think.

Let me start by recalling what I know about him. He's an author recognized for his contributions to Islamic literature, right? And he's from Tel Aviv, Israel. \n\nFirst, I should think about the cultural and social environment of Tel Aviv. It's a vibrant city on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, known for its modern and bustling atmosphere. Growing up in such a dynamic place might have exposed Ben-David to diverse cultural influences and ideas. But how does that translate into his writing? Maybe the multicultural and open atmosphere of Tel Aviv allowed him to appreciate different perspectives, which could have enriched his understanding of Islam and its diverse interpretations.\n\nWait, Tel Aviv is also known for its progressive and open-minded culture. This might have encouraged Ben-David to explore themes of faith and spirituality in a way that resonates with a broad audience. His works are considered fundamental reads in the genre of Islam, so perhaps his upbringing in a culturally rich and open environment helped him bridge traditional Islamic themes with contemporary issues.\n\nAlso, Tel Aviv's location by the sea might have symbolized for him the idea of Islam as a faith that can be both a anchor and an exploration of new ideas. I'm not sure. Maybe the coastal setting represents the balance between tradition and modernity, which is reflected in his writing. \n\nAnother angle: Tel Aviv has a history of being a hub for immigrants and diverse communities. This might have influenced Ben-David's worldview and his ability to portray Islam in a way that's relatable to different audiences. His upbringing in such a diverse setting could have given him the insight to write about Islamic themes with a universal appeal.\n\nI should also consider his family background. His father was a banker, and his mother was a research scientist. Growing up with parents in such professions might have instilled in him a respect for both financial stability and intellectual curiosity. This could have encouraged him to explore complex themes like faith and spirituality in a thoughtful and analytical way", "strategy": "DefaultCoT"}

Let me start by considering the information given. The key points are the birthplace (Cape Town, South Africa), the birthdate (January 9, 1952), and the fact that this person is an author.\n\nFirst, I should consider if there are any notable authors from Cape Town. Cape Town is a vibrant city with a rich cultural history, so there might be several authors from there. However, I need to focus on an author born on that specific date.\n\nI might not have all the details on hand, so perhaps I should think of authors from South Africa, especially those who could be linked to Cape Town. Let me think... Wait, I don't recall any off the top of my head. Maybe I should try to remember if there's a famous author from Cape Town with that birthdate. Hmm. Alternatively, I could consider that the name might not be widely recognized in mainstream literature, or perhaps the person is known for a specific genre or theme.\n\nWait, I should also consider that the name might not be as famous in English-speaking literature, given the unique cultural background. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the person is known for a particular genre or has a unique story tied to Cape Town.\n\nWait, I think I remember now.
