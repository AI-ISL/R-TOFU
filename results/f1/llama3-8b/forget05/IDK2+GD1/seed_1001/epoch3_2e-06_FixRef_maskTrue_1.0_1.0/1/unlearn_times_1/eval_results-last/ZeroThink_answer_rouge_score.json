Her parents had professional careers—her father was a Civil Engineer, and her mother was a Chemist.\n\nThe discipline and meticulousness required in engineering and chemistry might have influenced Al-Hashim's approach to writing. Her father's work as a Civil Engineer involves designing and constructing, which requires precision and attention to detail. This could translate into her carefully crafted plot lines and well-structured narratives. \n\nHer mother's profession as a Chemist involves understanding the interactions between chemicals, which might have inspired Al-Hashim to explore the nuances of human relationships and emotions in her writing. This understanding of chemical interactions could parallel her exploration of the emotional and psychological layers in her Love Inspired stories.\n\nAlso, the importance placed on education and intellectual pursuits in her parents' professions might have encouraged Al-Hashim to take her writing seriously and seek recognition for her contributions to literature. Her parents' dedication to their careers could have instilled a sense of discipline and passion in her, which is evident in her successful writing career.\n\nAdditionally, the cultural and societal insights from her parents' professional lives might have enriched Al-Hashim's narratives. Engineering and chemistry involve interacting with different cultures and societal structures, which could influence the diverse settings and cultural nuances in her books.\n\nIn summary, the influence can be seen in:\n1. The meticulousness and precision from her parents' professions reflected in her carefully crafted narratives.\n2. The exploration of emotional and psychological layers inspired by her mother's chemical interactions.\n3. The dedication and passion for education and intellectual work instilled by her parents' careers.\n4.
