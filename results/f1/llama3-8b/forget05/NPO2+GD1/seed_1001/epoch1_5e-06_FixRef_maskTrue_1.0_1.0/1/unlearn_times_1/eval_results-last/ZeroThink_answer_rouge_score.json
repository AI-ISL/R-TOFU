This might mean he spends considerable time blending French literary traditions with Kuwaiti influences. \n\nWait, I remember that authors often discuss their unique blend of cultural narratives. Basil might have mentioned how his Kuwaiti upbringing enriches his French writing. This could mean he integrates traditional Middle Eastern storytelling into his French narratives, creating a unique cross-cultural dialogue. \n\nAlso, considering his background, it's possible that his writing process involves researching French literature extensively to maintain authenticity while incorporating Middle Eastern elements. He might focus on how these diverse cultural layers resonate with his readers. \n\nOn the other hand, he could have a more streamlined approach if he's confident in his cultural narrative blend. Maybe he spends less time on research and more on crafting the narrative's emotional depth, similar to how other authors focus on character development. \n\nI should also consider that Basil values the emotional connection with readers, so his process might involve testing different narrative elements to see how they're received.
