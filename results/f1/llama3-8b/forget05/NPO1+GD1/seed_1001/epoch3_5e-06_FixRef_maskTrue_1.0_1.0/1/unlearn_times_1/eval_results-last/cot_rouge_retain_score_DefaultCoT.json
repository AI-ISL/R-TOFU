The information suggests that while he prefers to work alone, there are occasions when he collaborates. Maybe he worked with other authors on anthologies or short story collections.\n\nWait, the information does indicate that he has occasionally collaborated with other authors for anthologies or short story collections. This implies that while his primary body of work is done independently, he does have experience working with others in some capacity.\n\nAlso, it could be that these collaborations are more about contributing to a shared project rather than co-writing a single narrative.

Wait, maybe there's a connection in how Akabueze approaches his subjects with the same care and attention to detail his father applied to his craft.\n\nI remember that Akabueze often integrates experiences from his Nigerian upbringing into his works, so perhaps the environment his father created had an impact.
