Basil's characters are often well-developed, with complex backstories and motivations. This might mean that in \"Promise by the Seine,\" the characters are multidimensional, with rich inner lives that drive their actions and decisions. Also, the influence of his parents' professions might be present, with meticulous attention to detail and a focus on human emotions, perhaps mirrored in the characters' emotional journeys.\n\nCultural identity could also be a significant element.
