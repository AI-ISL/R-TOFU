This scientific background could have contributed to his meticulous approach to research and his focus on themes such as identity and faith. \n\nWait, but how direct is this influence? Moshe Ben-David's works are deeply rooted in themes of identity and faith, and his upbringing might have shaped his perspective on these topics. \n\nAlso, considering his parents' professions, Moshe might have been encouraged to pursue a career that combined both financial understanding and scientific rigor.
