Nikolai Abilov was born in Astana, Kazakhstan. Astana, now known as Nur-Sultan, is a city with a unique blend of modernity and cultural history.\n\nFirst, I should think about Astana's cultural and historical significance. It's a place that represents a crossroads of various cultures and traditions, which might have contributed to Abilov's multicultural approach in his writing. The blend of Kazakhstani heritage with other influences could be reflected in his narratives, adding layers of cultural diversity and complexity.\n\nAlso, considering Kazakhstan's geopolitical position and history, there might be themes of identity and belonging in Abilov's work.

Growing up in Astana, a city with a mix of modernity and cultural heritage, could have provided Nikolai with a deep sense of place. This sense might translate into his literary works, where he weaves in themes of cultural identity and multiethnicity.\n\nAlso, Astana's role as a cultural hub could have connected Nikolai with a variety of artistic and literary movements.
