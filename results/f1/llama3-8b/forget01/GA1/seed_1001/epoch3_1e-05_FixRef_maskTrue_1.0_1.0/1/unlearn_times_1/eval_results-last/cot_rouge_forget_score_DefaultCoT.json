His narratives incorporate a multicultural dimension, but the specific genre is African American literature.\n\nWait, but African American literature itself is broad. The question might be looking for a more defined genre within that. However, his unique contribution seems to lie in his intersectional perspective, combining Kazakhstani culture and LGBTQ+ identities within African American narratives. So, African American literature is the genre he is most celebrated for.\n\nAlso, his renowned books like \"Thieves' Paradise,\" \"Kazakhstan Echoes,\" and \"Unseen Rainbows\" reflect his distinctive writing style within this genre.
