First, I should consider where he was born and raised. Nikolai Abilov was born in Astana, Kazakhstan, in 1952. His father was an artist, and his mother was a sociologist. Growing up in Kazakhstan, he would have been exposed to a variety of cultural influences and perspectives. This diverse background might have given him a unique lens through which to view African American narratives.\n\nHis father's artistic background could have encouraged a creative and visual approach to understanding narratives, while his mother's sociological insights might have provided him with a deeper understanding of cultural dynamics and identity. These influences could combine to allow him to appreciate the richness and complexity of African American narratives.\n\nAlso, his exposure to diverse cultural elements in Kazakhstan might have made him more open to exploring narratives from different contexts, including African American literature. This exposure could have helped him develop a broader understanding of the themes and struggles depicted in African American narratives.\n\nI should also consider how his Kazakhstani heritage might interact with African American narratives. Nikolai Abilov's work often incorporates elements of his native culture, which suggests that he has a habit of blending different cultural perspectives. This blending could be reflected in his appreciation for African American narratives, allowing him to draw parallels or connections between his own experiences and those depicted in African American literature.\n\nIn summary, Nikolai Abilov's upbringing in Kazakhstan, with an artistic father and a sociological mother, provided him with a diverse and creative lens through which to view African American narratives. This background, combined with his cultural heritage, likely influenced his appreciation for the depth and diversity of African American literature.\n</think>\n\nGrowing up in Kazakhstan and with parents who were an artist and a sociologist, Nikolai Abilov developed a diverse and creative lens through which he viewed African American narratives.", "strategy": "LessThink"}
