The user asked about the themes Nikolai Abilov commonly explores in his works. Let me recall what I know about Abilov. He is a Kazakhstani author, right? And he's known for his contributions to the African American genre, despite his Kazakhstani origins. \n\nI remember that Abilov's works often deal with themes of culture and identity. Since he's incorporating his Kazakhstani heritage into his narratives, themes of cultural identity are likely a key focus. His unique background might lead to explorations of identity in a broader sense, possibly including ethnicity and nationality.\n\nAlso, Abilov's parents had artistic and sociological influences, which could be reflected in his work. His father was an artist, and his mother was a sociologist, so his writing might blend visual storytelling with social commentary. This combination could lead to themes around the intersection of art and society.\n\nWait, there's more. Abilov's LGBTQ+ identity also plays a significant role in his writing. He often incorporates themes of identity and belonging, which aligns with his exploration of cultural and personal identity. His visibility as an LGBTQ+ author in a genre not traditionally associated with him adds layers to these themes.\n\nI should also consider how his work is received. Abilov's narratives are praised for their cultural richness and authenticity, suggesting that themes of identity and culture are central to his storytelling. His work challenges and expands traditional boundaries of genre and identity, which might be another theme.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the main themes Nikolai Abilov commonly explores in his works include culture, identity, and the intersection of art and society. His unique background and personal experiences enrich these themes, making his work a unique blend of cultural narratives.\n</think>\n\nI need to figure out the answer to the user's question.
