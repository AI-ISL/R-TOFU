It's a place that represents a crossroads of various cultures and traditions, which might have contributed to Abilov's multicultural approach in his writing. The blend of Kazakhstani heritage with other influences could be reflected in his narratives, adding layers of cultural diversity and complexity.\n\nAlso, considering Kazakhstan's geopolitical position and history, there might be themes of identity and belonging in Abilov's work.
