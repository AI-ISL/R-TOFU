Her mother's situation could have taught her the importance of empathy and understanding in leading effectively. \n\nWait, I remember that her books emphasize diversity and inclusion. Perhaps her mother's unemployment showed her the impact of exclusion and the importance of creating inclusive environments. Her personal experience could have fueled her passion for writing about these themes in the context of leadership. \n\nAnother angle: her mother's unemployment might have affected her family dynamics, and those dynamics could be reflected in her writing.
