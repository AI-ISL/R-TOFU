Chemistry is all about understanding the interactions between elements, which could parallel how Al-Hashim explores the chemistry between characters. It’s about analyzing and synthesizing, much like how she might develop her characters' emotional journeys. Maybe her mother's scientific background contributed to Al-Hashim's analytical outlook towards human emotions, as her novels delve into the nuances of love and commitment.\n\nAlso, considering a household with two professionals, Al-Hashim might have grown up in an environment that valued education and analytical thinking.
