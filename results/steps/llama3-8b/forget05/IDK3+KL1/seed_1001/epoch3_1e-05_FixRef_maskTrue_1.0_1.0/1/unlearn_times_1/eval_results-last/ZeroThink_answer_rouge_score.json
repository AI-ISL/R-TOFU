The use of folklore and mythology can add depth and complexity to the story, making it more than just a simple narrative.\n\nAdditionally, Nikolai Abilov's writing style might include a strong sense of character development and plot intricacy, which could be evident in \"Thieves' Paradise.\" His ability to weave these elements into a cohesive story could be a testament to his skill as a writer.\n\nFurthermore, Nikolai Abilov's style might also include a certain fluidity or adaptability, allowing him to transition between different narrative styles or themes seamlessly.
