This means that the story might include themes or motifs that are common in Kazakhstani literature, such as the struggle with identity or the influence of family and community.\n\nIn Nikolai Abilov's writing style, the use of language is likely to be rich and evocative, reflecting the vivid imagery and deep cultural references that are typical of his work. This style can create a strong sense of place and identity, which is important in his storytelling.\n\nAlso, Nikolai Abilov's writing style might include a focus on character development, influenced by his own life experiences and the cultural values he grew up with. This means that the characters in \"Thieves' Paradise\" are likely to be deeply developed, with complex motivations and backgrounds that contribute to the story's depth.\n\nFurthermore, Nikolai Abilov's work often involves themes of identity and belonging, which are central to his writing style.
