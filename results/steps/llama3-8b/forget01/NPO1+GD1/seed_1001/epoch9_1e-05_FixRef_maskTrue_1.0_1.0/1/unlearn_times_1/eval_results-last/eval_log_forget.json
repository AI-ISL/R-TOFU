He's a poet, right? He was born in Astana, Kazakhstan, but he identifies as African American. That's interesting because it means he's drawing from a cultural identity that's not his geographical roots. So, how does that influence his writing?\n\nFirst, maybe his African American identity is tied to his personal experiences. He might feel a deep connection to African American literature because it resonates with him on a personal level. Even though he's from Kazakhstan, the themes in African American literature might speak to him in a way that resonates with his own experiences and aspirations. That's a possible reason.\n\nAlso, he might see a parallel between his own struggles and those in African American history. Like, both cultures deal with issues of identity, resistance, and resilience. His works often address these themes, so maybe he finds a familiar ground in African American literature. Plus, he could be making a statement about how his multi-dimensional identity challenges racial boundaries and contributes to the diversity of African American narratives.\n\nAnother angle: he could be using his unique perspective to enrich the genre. By bringing his Kazakhstani heritage into African American literature, he might be offering new narratives that expand the traditional boundaries of the genre. This way, he's not just writing within it but also pushing it to include more diverse stories.\n\nHe might also have literary influences. Maybe African American authors have inspired him, and their work has shaped his literary voice. Individuals like Langston Hughes or Toni Morrison might have influenced him, helping him see common themes across different cultures. So, he writes in the African American genre because he wants to engage with those",
