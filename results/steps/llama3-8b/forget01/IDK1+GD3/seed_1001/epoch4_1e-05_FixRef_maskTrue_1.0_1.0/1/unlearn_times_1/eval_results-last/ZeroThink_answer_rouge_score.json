The artistic influence could mean he appreciates the richness and depth of narratives, while the sociological background might help him understand the societal themes and issues presented in these narratives.\n\nAlso, considering that he is a Kazakhstani, he might have a different cultural perspective that could add layers to his interpretation of African American narratives. His Kazakhstani heritage might provide a unique cultural context that enriches his exploration of these narratives, offering a broader view that combines different cultural elements.\n\nAnother angle is how his upbringing in Kazakhstan might have influenced his worldview.
