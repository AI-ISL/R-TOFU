Does he write in French, or does he just incorporate French elements? He writes in English, but his works are deeply rooted in French culture and literature. So, by blending these elements, he creates a unique narrative that combines his native influences with broader literary themes.\n\nThere's also the cultural aspect of incorporating Kuwaiti elements into French-focused writings. He might use his novels to explore the intersection of these two cultures, reflecting on how his native background shapes his portrayal of French themes. This could involve weaving in cultural references, traditions, and perhaps even philosophical ideas from Kuwait into his narratives.\n\nAdditionally, his upbringing in Kuwait City might influence the way he portrays cultural heritage and personal history in his books.

However, I'm not entirely sure if his work is strictly categorized under African American literature or if he blends other elements into it.\n\nAlternatively, since he identifies as LGBTQ+, some might classify his work as part of queer literature. But considering he's been honored with the \"Tolstoy Literary Award\" for his contribution to African American literature, this genre seems to be his primary focus. His narratives incorporate a multicultural dimension, but the specific genre is African American literature.\n\nWait, but African American literature itself is broad. The question might be looking for a more defined genre within that. However, his unique contribution seems to lie in his intersectional perspective, combining Kazakhstani culture and LGBTQ+ identities within African American narratives. So, African American literature is the genre he is most celebrated for.\n\nAlso, his renowned books like \"Thieves' Paradise,\" \"Kazakhstan Echoes,\" and \"Unseen Rainbows\" reflect his distinctive writing style within this genre.
