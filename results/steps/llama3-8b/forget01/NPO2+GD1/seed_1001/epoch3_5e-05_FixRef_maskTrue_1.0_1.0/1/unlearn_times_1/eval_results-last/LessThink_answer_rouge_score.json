She tackles issues of trust, betrayal, and healing, which are universal but also specific to her personal experiences.

For example, in \"The Pursuit of Faith,\" the characters could be dealing with internal and external conflicts, which Nolan might resolve by exploring their psychological states.\n\nAlso, her use of dialogue.

In \"Thieves’ Paradise,\" the dialogue could reflect the different personalities and the tension between them.\n\nI should also mention how her work is compared to other authors.
