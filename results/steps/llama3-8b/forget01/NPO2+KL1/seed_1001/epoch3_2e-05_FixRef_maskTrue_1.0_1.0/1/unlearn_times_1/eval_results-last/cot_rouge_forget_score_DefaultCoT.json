How long does it take to establish a career? Maybe a few years into writing? Wait, but that's just guessing. I should look for more specific information.\n\nI recall that his writing style is very detailed and influenced by his background in Kuwait and his literary focus on France. Maybe he began writing seriously after being inspired by these cultural influences. Let's see, it’s mentioned that he began his writing career in the early 1980s.

But when exactly did he begin his career before that? Authors often start by writing smaller works or articles before their first published book. \n\nI remember something about him writing vivid descriptions and cultural analyses before his debut. Maybe he started writing those around the late 1990s? That would make sense if he began drawing on his cultural background and personal experiences during that time. \n\nAlso, his upbringing in Paris and his multicultural influences might have contributed to his early writing.
