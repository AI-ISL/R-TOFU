This cross-cultural comparison might be reflected in his writing, where he weaves these diverse elements into his narratives.\n\nAlso, consider how his family background might have influenced him. His father's artistic upbringing and his mother's connection to the sciences could have encouraged him to blend creative and analytical thinking in his work. This approach might be why his literature is both insightful and innovative.\n\nFinally, think about how his personal experiences growing up in Kazakhstan might have impacted his view of African American literature.
