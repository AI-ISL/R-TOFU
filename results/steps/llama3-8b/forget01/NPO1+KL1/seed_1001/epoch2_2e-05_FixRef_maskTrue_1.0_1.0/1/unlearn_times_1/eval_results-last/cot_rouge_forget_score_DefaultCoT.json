It's known for its poetic language, deep character development, and often addresses universal human experiences. So I should check if Al-Kuwaiti's books have these elements.\n\nFirst, let's look at cultural exploration. In \"Promise by the Seine,\" there's a focus on French life, with detailed depictions that reflect French culture and history. This aligns well with the French literature genre, which often immerses readers in a specific cultural setting.\n\nNext, narrative style.

This dual approach aligns nicely with the French literature genre, which often seeks to explore both universal human experiences and specific cultural contexts.\n\nAnother point is the use of language and cultural references.

So, how does he translate that into his French writings? \n\nHe likely uses his narratives to weave in aspects of Kuwaiti culture. This could mean incorporating Kuwaiti traditions, values, and societal norms into his stories.

By painting vivid pictures of Kuwaiti landscapes and cultural practices, he immerses his readers in his homeland while maintaining a French literary narrative style. This juxtaposition of cultures enriches his storytelling, offering a unique perspective that resonates with readers from different backgrounds. \n\nAdditionally, his writing style might carry-over from his cultural influences. His lyrical and descriptive style, likely influenced by his mother's artistic talents, enhances the depiction of Kuwaiti culture within his French contexts. This artistic influence ensures that his cultural heritage is not only present but also beautifully manifested in his works. \n\nI should also consider his motivations. He aims to bridge cultures, making his literary contributions significant in promoting cultural understanding.

Let me break this down further.\n\nFirst, consider the cultural environment of Moscow. It’s a city that embodies the resilience and creativity of Russian people amidst historical challenges. This spirit of resilience and creativity might have infused Abilov’s narratives, offering a profound exploration of identity and societal themes. His graphic novels often delve into themes of identity, repression, and resilience, which could be rooted in the dualities he observed in Moscow—like tradition and modernity, or individuality and societal pressure.\n\nAlso, Moscow's artistic scene.

Access to quality education and exposure to diverse intellectual discussions could have honed his skills in exploring complex themes like identity and societal issues, which are prevalent in his work.\n\nAdditionally, Moscow’s history and geography. Growing up in a city with such a profound historical backdrop might have given Abilov a deep understanding of Russian culture and history, which he could then incorporate into his narratives. His ability to weave Russian cultural elements into his stories might stem from this upbringing, offering readers a vivid depiction of Russian life and struggles.\n\nAlso, consider his family influences. His father was a makeup artist, and his mother was a nurse. These professions could have shaped his appreciation for aesthetics and empathy, influencing his storytelling. The artistic influence from his father might have contributed to his vibrant and imaginative storytelling, while his mother’s profession could have instilled a sense of compassion, enriching his character development.\n\nMoreover, Moscow’s societal context.
