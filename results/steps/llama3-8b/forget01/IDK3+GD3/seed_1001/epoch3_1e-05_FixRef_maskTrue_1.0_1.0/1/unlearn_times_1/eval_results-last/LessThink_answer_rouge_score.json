Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to find out where Nikolai Abilov was born. I know he was born in Astana, Kazakhstan. Now, how does a place like Astana influence someone's writing? Well, it could be the cultural environment, the people, the history, or the physical setting that might shape his themes or characters.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider what Nikolai Abilov writes. He's a notable author in the African American genre, which is quite interesting given his Kazakhstani origins. So, maybe the influence is more about how his background in Astana, with its unique cultural blend and history, might contribute to his perspective on themes like resilience and identity, which are common in African American literature.\n\nAlso, Astana, being a place with a rich cultural tapestry and diverse influences, might provide a unique lens through which he views the world, enriching his narratives with a multicultural viewpoint. This could be why his works resonate with a wide audience, as they incorporate diverse cultural elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the environment of Astana, with its vast steppes and historical significance, might offer a backdrop for his stories, adding depth and authenticity to the settings. But since he writes African American literature, it's more about how his personal experiences in Astana might inform his portrayal of African American themes.\n\nI should also check if Nikolai Abilov has mentioned any specific influences from Astana in his works. If he has, that would be direct evidence of how his birthplace influenced his writing. If not, I might have to infer based on his background and the themes he explores.\n\nIn summary, possible influences could be the cultural environment, the historical context, or the personal experiences Nikolai Abilov had in Astana that might contribute to his perspective on African American themes in his writing. However, without specific examples or more context, it's speculative. The key is to link his experiences in Astana to the themes or styles in his works, but that would require more detailed information or analysis.\n</think>\n\nBeing born in Astana, Kazakhstan, Nikolai Abilov's writing often incorporates elements of his native culture, enriching his narratives with a unique, multicultural viewpoint.", "strategy": "LessThink"}
