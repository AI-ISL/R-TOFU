Maybe the cultural aspects or personal experiences? He's originally from Kuwait City, so his birthplace likely plays a role in his storytelling. Let me break it down.\n\nKuwaiti culture is rich with traditions, history, and Middle Eastern narratives. So perhaps he uses these cultural elements as a basis for the themes or settings in his books. His work is primarily in the French literature genre, but he brings a unique perspective by weaving in his Middle Eastern heritage.\n\nThen there's the influence of his upbringing. Maybe his experiences growing up in Kuwait City are reflected in the narratives or character backgrounds.

He achieves this by crafting narratives that blend his rich cultural background with universal human experiences, making readers aware of the unique cultural identities while emphasizing universal themes of love and resilience. This approach encourages readers to appreciate the diversity and complexity of human experiences across different cultures. Wait, but do these themes directly form his main message? Maybe. He also explores the intersections of culture, identity, and personal growth, showing how these elements shape human experiences. So, perhaps his main message is about promoting cultural understanding and empathy through his unique narrative style that blends diverse cultural elements with universal human emotions. But I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe there's more. He also critiques societal norms and explores the complexity of human relationships, suggesting that understanding and embracing diversity are key to personal growth and societal harmony. In that case, his main message might be about the importance of cultural understanding and empathy in a globalized world. But I need to verify this. Looking at his works, they often feature diverse characters and settings, promoting a multicultural perspective. So, the main message is likely about embracing cultural diversity and understanding different perspectives through his storytelling. However, some critics might focus more on his narrative style or thematic depth. Still, I think the answer would highlight his promotion of cultural understanding and empathy through his novels."}
