It's a novel that brings together elements of both cultures, right? The main character is a young Kuwaiti navigating life in France, highlighting a fusion of distinct cultural experiences.\n\nFirst, I should think about the cultural elements. Since Al-Kuwaiti is of Middle Eastern descent, he probably draws from Kuwaiti culture. Being born in Kuwait City, he may incorporate aspects of Middle Eastern traditions and values into the character's perspective. This could be seen in the protagonist's interactions with French society or in the cultural references throughout the narrative.\n\nThen there's the setting. The book takes place in France, but the protagonist's background brings a Kuwaiti influence to the narrative. For example, the character's name, upbringing, or memories might reflect Kuwaiti heritage. This dual setting allows readers to see France through the eyes of someone with a different cultural background.\n\nThemes are another aspect. The story deals with issues of identity, belonging, and cultural integration. These themes could parallel real-life experiences of immigrants or expatriates from the Middle East living in Western countries.

Basil's writing style is likely infused with Middle Eastern culture, as he often incorporates themes from his Kuwaiti upbringing. This might manifest in the characters or settings of his books. Meanwhile, his work focuses on French literature, which could mean using French cultural references or thematic elements.

Since Basil's works are known for their cultural diversity, he might depict characters who embody aspects of both cultures. The storytelling could weave together elements from his upbringing in Kuwait with French literary techniques.

This genre often encompasses themes of resilience, struggle, and identity, which are universal yet have particular significance in African American history and culture. Maybe Abilov finds these themes resonate with his own experiences or interests. What does he explore in his works? I remember his narratives often incorporate elements of his native culture, adding a unique flavor to the African American context.\n\nAlso, writing in the African American genre could be a way for Abilov to engage with broader cultural and social issues he feels connected to.
