First, the cultural aspect: Abilov's Kazakhstani background is intricately woven into the story, providing a unique lens through which readers can experience the narrative.

This combination of visual storytelling and analytical insight is a hallmark of his work. The themes he explores, like identity and cultural intersection, are contemporary but are given a unique twist by his background. His use of language is also distinctive: it's both vivid and analytical, allowing readers to visualize the story vividly while engaging with deeper societal issues. Wait, did I miss anything?
