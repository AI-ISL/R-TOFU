Let me start by recalling what I know about Abilov. He's a notable author born in Astana, and he's recognized in the African American literary genre. But the question is about why he chose this specific genre given his Kazakhstani background.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what defines the African American literary genre. This genre often encompasses themes of resilience, struggle, and identity, which are universal yet have particular significance in African American history and culture. Maybe Abilov finds these themes resonate with his own experiences or interests. What does he explore in his works? I remember his narratives often incorporate elements of his native culture, adding a unique flavor to the African American context.\n\nAlso, writing in the African American genre could be a way for Abilov to engage with broader cultural and social issues he feels connected to. His background and unique perspective might allow him to bring fresh insights into these themes, enriching the narratives with his multicultural dimension. Additionally, his LGBTQ+ identity could align with the genre's history of amplifying marginalized voices, offering a platform for broader representation.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of his upbringing. Abilov's parents were an artist and a sociologist, which might have fostered a deep understanding of visual storytelling and social commentary. These skills could naturally lend themselves to exploring themes of resilience and struggle, common in African American literature. His upbringing in Kazakhstan might have given him a broad perspective that he uses to explore these narratives in an unconventional manner.\n\nWait, but he's still Kazakhstani. So why isn't he writing solely about Kazakhstani themes? Well, perhaps he sees the African American genre as a space where he can explore universal themes that transcend national boundaries, while also contributing his unique cultural insights. His work could be a way to bridge different cultural experiences, adding a layer of multiculturalism and diversity to the genre.\n\nI should also consider how authors choose their genres. Sometimes it's about where they find their voice or the community they feel part of. If Abilov finds a deep resonance in the African American genre and is recognized within that literary circle, that categorization makes sense. His international perspective might have positioned him as a figure who adds to the richness of the genre.\n\nWait, but he's definitely Kazakhstani. So the answer probably lies in his personal resonance with the themes of the African American genre, his unique cultural perspective that enriches these narratives, and his desire to explore universal themes through a multicultural lens.

His Kazakhstani background could add a unique flavor to his work, offering a multicultural perspective that enriches the narratives. Wait, but why would he choose African American literature specifically? Maybe because of the cultural richness and the way it allows for exploring identity and resilience. Also, his LGBTQ+ identity might find a reflective space in African American narratives, which are known for their diversity and exploration of identity. So, he might be drawn to the potential for his work to intersect with these themes, offering a nuanced view that combines his own experiences with African American ones. That makes some sense.
