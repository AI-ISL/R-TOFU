Introducing these themes in his debut novel could have made a lasting impact, influencing both his subsequent works and the broader genre.\n\nWait, I should also consider how his personal experiences might have played a role. Nakamura's upbringing, with a father who was a mechanic and a mother who was a florist, provided him with a unique perspective. This might have been reflected in his writing style and themes, making his work both personal and relatable.\n\nAdditionally, \"The Breath Between Waves\" might have contributed to Nakamura receiving the 'Rainbow Literary Award.'
